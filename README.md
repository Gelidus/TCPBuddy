Bluefire

Lightweight TCP framework for node.js

This framework is under construction, ETA 1 month to alpha release with first tools.

There are no public exmaples because framework is now used on private projects ( while still developing first version )

Works well with:
----------------

packetbuddy and packetbuddyxml

Thank you for your patience!

Currently supported core injections:
------------------------------------

$app - the core app
$taskmgr - task manager
$router - app router
